# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction in Bank

## Overview

Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction project for the banking sector. This Jupyter notebook, `CUSTOMER_CHURN_ANALYSIS.ipynb`, encompasses the entire project pipeline, from data exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Project Description

In response to the competitive landscape of the banking industry, this project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes customer demographics, transaction history, and interactions, various machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, logistic regression, k-means clustering, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are employed to identify key factors influencing customer churn.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Exploration

The notebook initiates with a thorough exploration of the dataset, providing statistical analyses, visualizations, and insights into the distribution of customer attributes.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Following exploration, the notebook covers data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the data for subsequent model training and evaluation.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

The core of the notebook involves the implementation of decision trees, logistic regression, k-means clustering, and artificial neural networks for predicting customer churn. Each model is trained, tuned, and evaluated, with performance metrics analyzed and visualized.

### 4. Practical Application

The notebook concludes with a section demonstrating the practical application of the predictive model. It explores how the model can be integrated into existing banking systems and suggests strategies for implementing proactive customer retention measures.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Open and run the `CUSTOMER_CHURN_ANALYSIS.ipynb` notebook, following the step-by-step instructions.

Feel free to adapt and extend the notebook to fit your specific dataset or requirements.
