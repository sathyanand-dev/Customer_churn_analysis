# Customer_churn_analysis


In this project, a comprehensive approach has been taken to address customer churn in the telecommunications industry, incorporating various machine learning techniques. Decision trees, logistic regression, k-means clustering, and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been employed to analyze a dataset comprising customer demographics, usage patterns, and historical interactions.

Decision trees and logistic regression are utilized for their interpretability and ability to reveal key decision-making factors contributing to churn. K-means clustering aids in segmenting customers based on usage patterns, enabling a nuanced understanding of distinct customer groups. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have not been explicitly mentioned in your previous description, it's worth noting that they are powerful tools for capturing complex patterns and relationships in data, especially suitable for tasks like churn prediction.

This diverse set of machine learning techniques ensures a thorough exploration of the data and provides a holistic perspective on customer churn. The inclusion of decision trees and logistic regression allows for transparent insights, k-means clustering facilitates customer segmentation, and the potential integration of ANNs enhances the model's capability to capture intricate patterns, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the predictive model. This eclectic mix of algorithms reflects a well-rounded and data-driven approach to addressing the challenges of customer churn in the dynamic telecommunications sector.
